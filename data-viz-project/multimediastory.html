          Venezuela has an arsenal of Russian weapons and armed civilian cells that could mount a guerrilla war. But a coup against President Nicolás Maduro? Don’t count on it.

            The scenario has been war-gamed in foreign ministries and military academies for years. A volley of American cruise missiles, launched from ships off the Caribbean coast, slams into Venezuelan radar sites and air bases. Television screens across the hemisphere flicker with grainy footage of explosions. Within hours, Washington declares that the operation is limited, calibrated and aimed at forcing President Nicolás Maduro to step aside.
          </p>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            But in Caracas, military planners see a different story. Their radar network may be damaged, their air force grounded, yet the government still commands tens of thousands of troops, paramilitary groups embedded in neighborhoods and an intelligence apparatus built to sniff out dissent. The first wave of strikes, they believe, would not topple the government. It would instead be the opening chapter in a slower, more unpredictable conflict.

                On paper, Venezuela’s conventional forces look outmatched. The United States fields modern aircraft, precision munitions and an intelligence network that can map Venezuelan installations down to individual bunkers. Yet officers who have studied the country’s defenses say the first salvo of U.S. missiles would confront a patchwork of Soviet-era radar, mobile launchers and hardened shelters, all designed to keep at least part of the arsenal intact after a surprise attack.
              </p>

              <p class="story-paragraph">
                Over the last two decades, Moscow supplied Caracas with surface-to-air missile batteries, Sukhoi fighter jets and armored vehicles. Some of that equipment has fallen into disrepair amid Venezuela’s economic collapse. Still, analysts say even a fraction of those systems surviving the first strikes could complicate American operations, forcing U.S. planners to fly higher, launch from farther offshore and rely more on standoff weapons than low-flying jets.

                “They do not need to contest the skies for long,” said one retired South American air force commander, who requested anonymity to discuss classified briefings. “They only have to make it costly enough that Washington thinks twice about continuing the campaign or sending ground forces.”

            The first days would likely unfold as a contest of endurance and perception. U.S. officials would emphasize destroyed airframes and shattered runways. Venezuelan state television would show images of intact missile batteries, soldiers marching under national flags and what it claimed were captured fragments of American weapons. Each side would compete to define the narrative: a quick, surgical intervention in Washington’s telling, or a heroic defense of sovereignty in Caracas’s version.
          </p>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            Civilians, caught between those narratives, would feel the disruption long before they heard the first blast. Fuel and electricity would be rationed to prioritized installations. Roadblocks would tighten around major cities. And in the barracks, officers would quietly revisit contingency plans that assume the worst, not just from foreign adversaries, but from their own ranks.

                For years, the Maduro government has insisted that its real shield is not its aging fleet of jets, but its network of armed civilian groups. Known as colectivos and people’s militias, these cells grew from neighborhood organizations, party loyalists and informal security squads. In theory, they would mobilize if foreign troops landed or if opposition forces tried to exploit chaos in the streets.
              </p>

              <p class="story-paragraph">
                Human rights groups have long accused some of these units of intimidating protesters and silencing critics. In a wartime scenario, analysts fear they could morph into irregular forces, blending with the population during the day and emerging at night to harass foreign troops or Venezuelan units seen as wavering. Their knowledge of side streets, fuel depots and informal smuggling routes could be far more valuable than their rifles and motorcycles.

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            U.S. commanders who served in Iraq and Afghanistan say this is the scenario that keeps them wary. A limited bombing campaign could, in theory, weaken Maduro without sending American soldiers into the alleyways of Caracas. Yet the more the government leans on militias and allied gangs to keep order, the harder it becomes to distinguish between combatants and civilians, or to imagine a neat day when the fighting simply stops.

            Even without foreign boots on the ground, militias could shape the conflict by sabotaging infrastructure, seizing food shipments or taxing migration routes out of the country. “You do not need to defeat the United States,” said a Latin American security researcher at a European think tank. “You only need to convince enough Venezuelans that the chaos after intervention would be worse than the crisis they already know.”

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            In Washington, the fantasy version of the story ends with a tidy twist: under pressure from sanctions and airstrikes, a circle of senior officers turns on Mr. Maduro, funnels him to an airstrip and declares itself ready to negotiate a transition. That is the plotline that has circulated in policy papers and congressional hearings for years. But officers, analysts and former Venezuelan officials say that possibility grows more remote with every crisis the government survives.
          </p>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            Over time, the president has fused the upper ranks of the armed forces with business interests, intelligence services and ruling-party structures. Generals sit on the boards of state companies, oversee lucrative import contracts and control segments of the oil and mining industries. Many have been personally targeted by foreign sanctions. For them, a negotiated exit does not just mean losing power; it may mean facing criminal charges abroad.
          </p>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            “You are asking a small group of people to dismantle the system that protects them,” said a former Venezuelan diplomat who now lives in exile. “They may be unhappy, but they also know that any new government would be under pressure to investigate what happened in the last decade.”
          </p>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            The intelligence apparatus, shaped by years of Cuban advising and internal purges, also works against a clean break. Officers who grumble about shortages or pay are monitored. Those suspected of plotting are quietly sidelined, arrested or pushed into exile. The result is a military command that is more cautious than enthusiastic, but still deeply intertwined with the presidential palace.
          </p>

              Promotions, business concessions and access to foreign currency have tied senior officers’ fates to the survival of the Maduro government.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            Past uprisings, including a failed uprising led by a group of officers in 2019, have reinforced the lesson that the government will reward loyalty and punish hesitation. After that episode, commanders who rallied to Mr. Maduro received new posts and perks. Those who waited, hoping to see who would prevail, found themselves reassigned to distant garrisons or eased into retirement.
          </p>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            For ordinary Venezuelans, many of whom have already endured blackouts, food shortages and a collapsed currency, the prospect of airstrikes and a militarized capital does not automatically translate into hope. Surveys and interviews suggest a population tired of both the government’s mismanagement and the opposition’s fractured strategies, wary of becoming the terrain for a proxy fight between global powers.
          </p>

          <p class="story-paragraph">
            In that sense, the question facing Venezuela is less about what happens in the first hours of a U.S. attack and more about the months that would follow. A military that survives the opening strikes, militias that move into the spaces they leave behind and elites who fear accountability as much as defeat could lock the country into a prolonged stalemate. A coup might still feature in the rumors exchanged in embassy corridors and intelligence reports. On the streets of Caracas, though, it feels like the least likely outcome of all.
